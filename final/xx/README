Project description:
This project mainly done the following works:
1. The goal of this game is to kill all enemies.

2. use object pool to bullet, and show how many bullet are still alive and how many bullets are in the freelist 
    in the information HUD. Also the HUD will show how to move the player and other useful information, you can 
    press F1 to call HUD window.

    all fishes will be killed and regenerate them again, and the player will be back to original position.

4. Player can shoot and kill other fishes.

5. Use collision detection and use chunks way to explode NPC

6. I add some AI algorithm to the enemies, when the enemies find they are too close to player, they will change their
    direction

7. I add some sound and music to my game, and it looks pretty good


I have checked that no meomery leak in my own code.
