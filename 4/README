Project description:
This project mainly finish 4 parts:
1. use two background image, 

2. create a Player class, and can control it by "A, S, D, W"

3. write a Hub class, and will appear when the game begin, and then disappear after 2 second,
    but you can call it by hit "F1". Also this class will display FPS, seconds, and operate keys
    user can config the almost every for hud through xml.

4. I have two vectors to deposite my sprites. when deal with my bubble vector, the bubble will 
    be randomly zoom, and then sort them, then display the big bubbles in front, and small bubbles
    display between two background. Then I also have a TwoWayMultiSprite vector, all fishes are deposited
    int this vector, I didnot sort them, they all have a size called scale, then just display the big fishes
    in front, and small fishes in back.


For final project, I may make a game like this one, maybe user can control a player, and the player can shot
the fishes. 


I have checked that no meomery leak in my own code.

How you made your sprites:
 I get most of my orignal images from this address, I deal this images by PS and GIMP, and then get the image I want.
